  191 - Append Argument
  -------

  ### Question
  
  For given function type `Fn`, and any type `A` (any in this context means we don't restrict the type, and I don't have in mind any type ðŸ˜‰) create a generic type which will take `Fn` as the first argument, `A` as the second, and will produce function type `G` which will be the same as `Fn` but with appended argument `A` as a last one.

type AppendArgument<Fn, A> =
    Fn extends (...args: [...infer Args]) => infer R
    ? (...args: [...Args, A]) => R
    : never;
